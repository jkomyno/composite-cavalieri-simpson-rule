# composite-cavalieri-simpson-rule

Broadcasted version of the composite Cavalieri-Simpson rule using Python's numpy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description

The proposed Python implementation is thought as a translation of the Matlab file presented for the final laboratory exam
of the Numerical Analysis Course at the University of Padova.
This script, along with the theory exam, awarded me full marks (30/30).

## Requirements

Github's embedded Jupyter Notebook viewer should be sufficient to get a glimpse of the Cavalieri-Simpson algorithm implementation.
In order to execute it locally, I recommend installing Python 3.6.x and the latest version of numpy (1.15.x).
